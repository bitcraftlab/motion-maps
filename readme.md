## Motion Maps of Dance ##

This is the repository of the Choreographic Maps project, started at the [5th Choreographic Coding Lab](http://choreographiccoding.org/content/5th-choreographic-coding-lab-14-19-september-2015) at UCLA. More information can be found on the [Motion Maps Hackpad](https://motionbank.hackpad.com/Motion-Maps-of-Dance-bCp115GQkTE).

## Ideas ##

* **MotionGram Explorer**: Using MotionGrams as a means to explore motion in recordings of dance
* **MotionMap Explorer**: Folding the timeline of dance recording(s) on a 2D Self-Orgnanizing Map
